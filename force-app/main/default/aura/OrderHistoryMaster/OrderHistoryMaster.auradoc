	<aura:description>This component is a container to show Order Details, Restaurant Details and Previous Order components.
	This is an existing implementation where the three order history aura components were added on Lightning page. But due to certain limitation and the 
	various use cases that were suppose to work in combination of Lightning page and Workspace API, which did not work, this component was created to address those use cases.
