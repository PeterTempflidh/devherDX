    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},

We made several attempts to contact you at &lt;NUMBER&gt;. In the past week, your foodpanda device has been unreachable for &lt;X%&gt; of your opening hours, with a daily average unreachability of &lt;X&gt; minutes.

You may receive automated calls and your restaurant may be closed if your device remains unreachable, and you will not receive any orders.

To ensure that your restaurant is reachable and can receive orders, please check that
● your device is switched on with the foodpanda app open on the screen
● your network or WiFi connection is strong

If your contact number has changed or if you are experiencing device issues, please contact us via this form: &lt;SG / MY Formstack link&gt;

Best regards,
&lt;Your Name&gt;</textOnly>
