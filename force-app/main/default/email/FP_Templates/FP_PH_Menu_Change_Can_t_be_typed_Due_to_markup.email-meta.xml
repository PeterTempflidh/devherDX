    <textOnly>Dear Restaurant Partner,

You have recently requested a menu update for your online menu (# {!Case.CaseNumber}).
We have noticed however that the prices in the menu you sent us do not match the dine-in prices of your menu.
We would like to kindly request you that check again the online menu and send us the updated prices so that we can proceed with the changes you have requested.

Any questions? Feel free to contact us per E-Mail *partner@foodpanda.ph* or via phone under +63 2 555 5205.

We are happy to help you!


Regards,
Your foodpanda Partner Care Team</textOnly>
