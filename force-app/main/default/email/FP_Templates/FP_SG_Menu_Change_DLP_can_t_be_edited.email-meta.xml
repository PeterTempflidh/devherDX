    <textOnly>Dear Restaurant Partner,

You have recently requested Dish Pictures to be displayed with your menu (# {!Case.CaseNumber}).
Unfortunately, we could not upload them because they are not compliant with our standards.

Please ensure that the pictures you want to use are compliant with the following Picture Guidelines:

Take food Pictures either in a top view angle (90°) or flat view angle (0°)
Dish has to be centered in the middle
No side product that is not delivered / No disturbing background, the dish is focus
Image size: Min 4000px : 2925px



Please note that without having the dish information completed, we won’t be able to put any new items online.

Any questions? Feel free to contact by submitting the request through form https://foodpandasg.formstack.com/forms/foodpanda_support or via phone at +65 3158 3673.

We are happy to help you!

Regards,
Your foodpanda Partner Care Team</textOnly>
