    <subject>foodpanda: Commission Negotiation Request</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Account.Name},

Thank you for reaching out to foodpanda.

We have reviewed &lt;Restaurantâ€™s Name&gt; data and we regret to inform you that a lower commission rate is financially unsustainable for foodpanda.

Please note that foodpanda needs to generate $11.40 (excluding delivery fee) from every order to break-even. According to your restaurant&apos;s data, the average amount that foodpanda generates from &lt;Restaurant Name&gt;, on a per order basis, is 35% X $25.00 (average basket size) = $8.75, representing a net loss of $2.64 on every order. Despite this ongoing loss, we invest most of our revenue back into our Marketing and Logistics systems to support the restaurants.

We seek your kind understanding in the matter.

Regards,
&lt;Agent Name&gt;</textOnly>
