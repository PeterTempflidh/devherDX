    <subject>Delivery Hero - First Time Customer Discount Listing Confirmation</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Great news! As requested, we have created and enabled a new discount campaign for {!Account.Restaurant_Name__c}. We hope this will entice more new customers to order from your restaurant soon.
Here is the confirmation and a few things to know.

New First-time Customer Discount Campaign:
% Off For First Time Customers:
Campaign Voucher Code:
Campaign Expiry Date: N/A

A few important things to know:
1) Our system will only start recording customers to this campaign from now onwards. Therefore, you might have a few existing customers who have ordered from you before that use this discount. However, once their details have been recorded to this campaign, they won&apos;t be able to use the discount again. This should happen only rarely.
2) The discount will apply for the full order amount - including any deals or delivery fees.
3) It is only valid for online payment orders, and not for cash.
4) Customer is required to enter Campaign voucher code at checkout to redeem discount.
5) This campaign is to be funded by {!Account.Restaurant_Name__c}.
6) Voucher amount will be subtracted after the customer has reached the minimum order value.

Example Scenario:

Minimum order of restaurant is $25.00
Customer orders for exactly $25.00
Customer redeems 10% first time customer discount using voucher code
Final order amount of $22.50 will be transmitted to the restaurant

Do let us know if you have any further questions. Thanks {!Contact.FirstName}!

Kind Regards,
