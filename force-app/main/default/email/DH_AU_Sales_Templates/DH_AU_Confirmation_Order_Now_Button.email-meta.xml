    <subject>Order Now Button Installation - Delivery Hero</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},
Thanks for your interest in implementing an &quot;Order Now&quot; button from Delivery Hero! This will enable online ordering from your own website, and drive more orders for your restaurant.

Here is the information your web-master/web-designer needs to implement on your website. Please forward this email to them at your earliest convenience.

Please choose from the attached graphic files as your Order Now button(s)
We recommend that you place it prominently on every page of your website to gain maximum exposure, with high order conversions
Make sure to link your Order Now button to this URL, so visitors will be directed to the menu page and be able to order: [Mediaplex-URL]
Please add the URL as a “do-follow” link to increase the chances of your menu getting a good Google rank to gain more orders

[OPTIONAL]:
I also confirm that we will charge a discounted commission of [net commission]% for orders that are accessed via this Order Now button link.

Thanks {!Contact.FirstName}! Feel free to get back to us if you have any questions or need further assisitance, we&apos;ll be happy to help.

Kind regards,
{!User.Name}
