    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Attached are some great menu printing offers we have available.

For every menu printed, Delivery Hero pays for a $10 voucher so that new customers can discover your delicious food. We pay for these vouchers so it doesn’t cost you anything.

Our menu printing offer consists of the following 3 options:

Option 1: Print with Delivery Hero using Delivery Hero’s available designs/template
Option 2: Print with Delivery Hero using YOUR OWN design/template

Price with $10 Delivery Hero voucher:
10,000 = $550 (5.5¢/ea)
25,000 = $950 (3.8¢/ea)
50,000 = $1,650 (3.3¢/ea)
100,000 = $3,300 (3.3¢/ea)

Our menus are A4 sized (297 x 210mm) DL 6pp, full color, 150g Gloss Art. Price includes design, shipping, and 2 rounds of amendments. Price excludes GST.

If you are interested in Option 1 or 2, you just need to let us know the quantity you require, and the voucher you prefer, and we will get the printing company to give you a call within 24hours to discuss design requirements. They will also collect a $90 deposit to get everything started.

Option 3: Print with your own printing company. - We will send you a $10 discount voucher for your customers that we pay for (attached is a sample voucher). For this option, just let us know and we can design and send you a voucher. This is completely free of charge.

Thank you!
