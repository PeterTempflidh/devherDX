    <textOnly>Dear Restaurant Owner,

We are pleased to let you know that {!Account.Name} is now online on www.deliveryhero.com.au. This means that from now new customers can order from your restaurant online and Delivery Hero will start sending you orders.

Please make the following checks to confirm the accuracy of the content for your restaurant:

Check the opening hours and your menu on {!Account.FrontEnd_URL__c} carefully to make sure all your dishes are listed and have the correct prices.
The opening hours on {!Account.00N20000002kwz8} should match the times you actually do delivery, that is the time you take your FIRST order for delivery until the time you take your LAST order for delivery.

If you have any change requests, please contact us on 1300 46 4376 or send an email to restaurant@deliveryhero.com.au .

Kind regards,
The Delivery Hero Team
