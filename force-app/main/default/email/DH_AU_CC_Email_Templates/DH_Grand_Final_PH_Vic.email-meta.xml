Dear Restaurant - {!Account.Name},

We would like to know if you will be open and doing delivery during the Grand Final Weekend and if you charge a public holiday surcharge.



Please reply to this email to let us know:



A: If you will be OPEN for delivery from 2nd-4th October



B: If yes, if you will have different operating hours AND



C: If you intend to charge a public holiday surcharge. Please note our website is not able to add public holiday surcharges, so unfortunately we will have to close your restaurant for that day.


Please note that if we do not receive confirmation that you will be open, we will have to close your restaurant for the Public Holiday.



Alternatively, you may contact us at any time on our direct contact number 1300 46 4376
