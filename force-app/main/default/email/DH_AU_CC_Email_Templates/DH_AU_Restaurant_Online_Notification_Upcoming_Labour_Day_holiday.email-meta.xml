    <textOnly>Dear Restaurant Owner,

We are pleased to let you know that {!Account.Name} is now online on www.deliveryhero.com.au. This means that from now new customers can order from your restaurant online and Delivery Hero will start sending you orders.

Please make the following checks to confirm the accuracy of the content for your restaurant:

Check the opening hours and your menu on {!Account.00N20000002kwz8} carefully to make sure all your dishes are listed and have the correct prices.
The opening hours on {!Account.00N20000002kwz8} should match the times you actually do delivery, that is the time you take your FIRST order for delivery until the time you take your LAST order for delivery.

We would also like to know if you will be open and doing delivery on the upcoming public holiday on Monday 1st October, and if you charge a public holiday surcharge. Please note our website is not able to add any public holiday surcharges, so unfortunately we will have to close your restaurant for that day if you do have a surcharge.

It would be greatly appreciated if you could please reply to this email to let us know:

a- If you will be open for delivery on the Monday 1st October

b- If yes, if you will have different operating hours AND

c- If you will have a public holiday surcharge for delivery orders

If you have any change requests, please contact us on 1300 46 4376 or send an email to restaurant@deliveryhero.com.au .

Kind regards,
The Delivery Hero Team
