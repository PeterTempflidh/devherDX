    <textOnly>05/03/2014

Dear Restaurant - {!Account.Name},

Oh no!  You are missing out on customers and orders because we may not have all your delivery suburbs.  The following suburbs are not on our website:

{!Account.OtherCountry__c}

Please reply yes if you deliver to the above suburbs or no if you don&apos;t.

Your current delivery suburbs on our website are:

{!Account.OtherCity__c}

Please let us know if there are any other suburbs we have missed, or if the delivery fees for these missing suburbs vary by suburb.

You can also call us on our direct contact number 1300 GO HERO (1300 46 4376).

Yours Truly
Delivery Hero Customer and Restaurant Care</textOnly>
